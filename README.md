## Project summary (max 250 words)
This project is aiming at providing a thorough guide for football lovers to learn about historic NFL game data by visualizing points gained by each team and predicting actions taken by the offense team. Our website contains a map, bar chart, pie chart and line chart that presents the historic play records for some popular NFL teams. It can be used for everyone who wants to learn more about different teams and their performances, and help them to decide which team they should support next time.
